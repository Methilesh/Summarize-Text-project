# Text Summarization using NLP and NLTK

This GitHub repository contains a Python application for text summarization using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, particularly the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). Text summarization is the process of generating a concise and coherent summary of a given text, which can be useful for quickly understanding the main points and ideas within a document.

## Introduction

Text summarization is a valuable tool in information retrieval and natural language processing. This project provides a simple and easy-to-use Python application that leverages NLTK to perform text summarization. It employs extractive summarization techniques, which identify and extract the most important sentences from a given text.

## Features

- Extractive summarization using NLTK.
- Supports summarization of both single and multiple documents.
- Customizable summary length.
- Command-line interface for easy interaction.

## Requirements

To run this text summarization tool, you will need the following:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- NLTK library (Natural Language Toolkit)

## Installation

1. Clone this GitHub repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/text-summarization-nlp.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd text-summarization-nlp
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies (NLTK):

   ```bash
   pip install nltk
   ```

4. Download NLTK data (if you haven't already):

   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('punkt')
   ```

## Usage

To summarize text using this application, follow these steps:

1. Run the `summarize.py` script from the command line, providing the path to the text file you want to summarize and the desired summary length:

   ```bash
   python summarize.py -f input.txt -l 3
   ```

   Replace `input.txt` with the path to your input text file and `3` with the desired number of sentences in the summary.

2. The script will generate a summary and display it in the console.

## Example

Suppose you have a text file named `sample.txt` with the following content:

```
This is a sample text. It demonstrates how the text summarization tool works. You can provide your text and set the summary length. The tool uses NLTK for summarization.
```

You can summarize this text by running the following command:

```bash
python summarize.py -f sample.txt -l 2
```

The output will be:

```
This is a sample text. The tool uses NLTK for summarization.
```
